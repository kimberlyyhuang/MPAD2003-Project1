# Project 1: Audit of a Data Visualization

Use one hashtag symbol (`#`) to create a level 1 heading like this one.

## Foreword

For this assignment, you must write a 1000-1500-word audit/critique of a third-party data visualization. It can come from a multimedia news article, a public health dashboard, a company’s annual report, etc. In this short paper, you must clearly state and describe the type/kind of visualization you are talking about. You must also discuss two of its strengths and two shortcomings. Make sure to give concrete examples, and to cite some of the mandatory readings and/or other relevant sources to support your claims. Don’t forget to include relevant screen captures. Your assignment must be written with the Markdown format and submitted on GitHub Classroom.

**Here are some useful resources for this assignment:**

* [GitHub's *Basic writing and formatting syntax* page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Did you notice how to create a hyperlink? In Markdown, we put the clickable text between square brackets and the actual URL between parentheses.

And to create an unordered list, we simply put a star (`*`) before each item.
